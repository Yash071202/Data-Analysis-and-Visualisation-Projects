Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my collection of data analysis projects! This repository contains three key analyses across different tools: Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. Below is a brief overview of each project:

Projects Overview
HR Attrition Analysis (Excel)
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition within an organization. The dataset explores various factors that could influence employee turnover, such as age, department, satisfaction levels, and work-life balance. The analysis uses Excel to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.
Key insights include identifying the most common reasons for attrition and potential strategies to retain employees.

Automobile Sales Analysis (Power BI)
In this project, I've created a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to analyze automobile sales data. The dashboard includes key metrics like sales trends, regional sales performance, and vehicle category preferences.
Interactive filters and visualizations allow stakeholders to gain insights into sales performance across different segments and time periods.

Sales Analysis (Tableau)
This project involves a detailed sales analysis using Tableau. It explores the relationship between sales performance and variables like product category, sales region, and time. The dashboard helps in identifying trends, areas for improvement, and optimal sales strategies.
Multiple views and filters allow the user to drill down into specific regions, products, or time frames.
